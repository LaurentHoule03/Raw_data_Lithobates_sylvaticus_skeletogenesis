Raw data from: Wood Frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) skeletogenic plasticity in anthropogenic habitats

These data were collected in 2004 and consist of habitat characteristics of semi-permanent ponds, skeletogenesis data of *Lithobates sylvaticus *and additionnal information on the specimens. These data allowed us to study the effect of logging activities of the development of the skeleton of Wood Frog.

Description of the data and file structure

These data are composed of three .xlsx files.

The raw_sequence.xlsx file contains raw data of observations on 58 tadpoles and froglets of Lithobates sylvaticus that were treated with the clear and stain method. These observations are associated with the state of development of skeletal structures. There are 126 lines representing skeletal elements and 58 columns (one for each specimen). The values of the data refer to three possible states of development: 0 refers to an absence of the element, 1 refers to a presence of cartilage for that element, and 2 refers to the presence of ossification for the element. The identification for each specimen refers to the pond ID and the Gosner stage of the specimen (e.g. D57ST25: pond D57 and Gosner stage 25).

The raw_enviro.xlsx file contains data of morphometric and physicochemical parameters of 30 ponds studied in association with the development of Lithobates sylvaticus. These ponds were associated with three habitat category (i.e. logged area, skidding trails and regenerated forest). Nine morphometric (length, width, maximum depth, and surface area) and physicochemical parameters (water temperature, transparency, dissolved oxygen concentration, pH, and conductivity) were measured in each pond.

The raw_spec_infos.xlsx file contains  information on the each specimen studied. This file contains the pond category of the pond from which the specimen came from, the Gosner stage and the estimated day post hatching (dph) of the specimen, the date of capture and the GPS location of the pond from which the specimen was collected.
